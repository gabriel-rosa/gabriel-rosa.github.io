It's finally happening! The first computer graphics meetup in the city of Florian√≥polis, Brazil, will happen today, the 15th of august 2019, at 18pm. 

We at [Audaces](https://www.audaces.com) have been meaning to host a meetup like this for a long time. A little over a year ago I didn't even know there were companies working with computer graphics in my area, but now that I know I wanna tell others, show what it is I do and hopefully inspire more people to get into the field.

The event will occur at [ACATE](https://www.acate.com.br/). You can find more about it on our [meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/Meetup-de-Computacao-Grafica-em-Florianopolis/events/263805407/) or in the banner below.
