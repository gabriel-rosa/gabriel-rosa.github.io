![Me](/img/me.jpg){: .center-block :}

My name is Gabriel Rosa e Silva. I was born and raised in the city of Florian√≥polis, Santa Catarina, the second southernmost state capital in Brazil. I'm interested mainly in **computer graphics**, but I've also dabbled a bit in **physical simulations**, **machine learning** and **electronics**.

I'm a self-taught graphics programmer working at [Audaces](https://www.audaces.com) on a 3D software for clothing design. Previously I spent nearly 4 years working at a university lab for Digital Signal Processing and Electronics ([LINSE](https://www.linse.ufsc.br/)), where I did everything from low-level programming for DSPs and embedded devices, to machine learning research for object detection and recognition.

I have a technical degree in **Telecommunications** from the Federal Institute of Santa Catarina (IFSC), obtained in 2013, as well as a bachelor's degree in **Electrical Engineering** from the Federal Unversity of Santa Catarina (UFSC), obtained in 2019. In my bachelor's thesis I explored applications in object detection using deep learning. If you know Portuguese, you can read it [here](https://repositorio.ufsc.br/handle/123456789/193167).
